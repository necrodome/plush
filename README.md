# The Plush Programming Language

Plush is an experimental toy programming language and virtual machine for fun and teaching purposes.
It follows a minimalistic design philosphy and draws inspiration from JavaScript, [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), Lua, Python and Rust.
Plush supports actor-based parallelism and is designed such that there is no global VM lock.
The language has straightforward semantics and is built around a simple stack-based interpreter. The codebase is well-commented, has very few depencencies, and good cross-platform support. It has been tested on Linux, Mac and Windows.
Please do note however that this project is very much a fun side-project and a work in progress. You're likely to run into bugs and
missing features.

If you think that Plush is cool, you can support my work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/maximecb) :heart:

The Plush language supports:
- Dynamic typing
- Classes and objects
- Closures/lambdas
- Separate `Float64` and `Int64` types
- Dynamic arrays aka vectors/lists
- Immutable UTF-8 strings
- Dictionaries with JSON-like syntax
- Memory safe, actor-based parallelism
- A native byte array type
- A simple frame buffer API for graphics and animations
- A simple audio output API
- An extensible set of host functions defined in `src/host.rs`

Caveats and limitations:
- The language is still very much incomplete
  - You may run into bugs or missing features
- Lack of error messages or good error handling
  - You may have to look at the source code to figure things out
  - We could use your help in improving error messages
- Copying garbage collector planned but not yet implemented
  - Currently relying on alloc-until-you-crash technology (TM)
- Imports, support for multiple source files planned but not yet implemented

For a detailed guide to the Plush language, please see the [Plush Language Quickstart](docs/language.md).

## WebAssembly Support

Plush can now be compiled to WebAssembly and run in web browsers! This allows you to:
- Run Plush programs directly in the browser without any installation
- Embed Plush in web applications
- Use Plush for client-side scripting

**Quick start:**
```sh
./build-wasm.sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000/wasm-example.html
```

For complete documentation on building and using the Wasm target, see [WASM.md](WASM.md).

**Note:** The Wasm build includes the core VM and language features but excludes SDL2-dependent functionality (graphics and audio). Actor-based concurrency, string operations, and all core language features work normally.

## Build Instructions

Dependencies:
- The [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- The [SDL2 libraries](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation)

### Installing Rust and SDL2 on macOS

Install the SDL2 package:
```sh
brew install sdl2
```

Add this to your `~/.zprofile`:
```sh
export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:$(brew --prefix)/lib"
```

Install the Rust toolchain:
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Installing Rust and SDL2 on Debian/Ubuntu

Install the SDL2 package:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

Install the Rust toolchain:
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Installing Rust and SDL2 on Windows

Follow the Windows-specific instructions to [install the Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Get `SDL2.dll` from one of [SDL2 Releases](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases).

Copy `SDL2.dll` (unzip) to the root of your cloned repo.

### Compiling the Project

```sh
cargo build
```

To run the test suite:
```sh
cargo test
```

To run a plush script:
```sh
# See example programs under /examples, /benchmarks and /tests
cargo run examples/helloworld.psh
cargo run examples/plasma.psh
```

## Open Source License

The code for Plush, its VM and associated tools is shared under the [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/maximecb/plush/blob/main/LICENSE). The example code in the `/examples` directory is shared under the [Creative Commons CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.

## Contributing

There is a lot of work to be done to get this project going and contributions are welcome.

A good first step is to look at open issues and read the available documentation. Another easy way to contribute
is to create new example programs showcasing cool things you can do with Plush, or to
[report any bugs and issues](https://github.com/maximecb/plush/issues) you encounter.
If you do report bugs, please provide as much context as possible, and the smallest reproduction you can
come up with.

You can also search the codebase for TODO or FIXME notes:
```sh
grep -IRi "todo" .
```

In general, smaller pull requests are easier to review and have a much higher chance of getting merged than large
pull requests. If you would like to add a new, complex feature or refactor the design of Plush, I recommend opening
an issue or starting a discussion about your proposed changes first.

Also please keep in mind that one of the core principles of Plush is to minimize dependencies to keep the VM easy
to install and easy to port. Opening a PR that adds dependencies to multiple new packages and libraries is
unlikely to get merged. If you believe you have a valid argument in favor of doing so, please open an issue to
share your point of view.
